                    You can’t fool people by dashing off a few generic words of praise (e.g., “Loved it,” “Will definitely go again," or “Best night ever!”). People don't put any stock in these types of reviews because they feel bland and untrustworthy. Details and specifics are what readers find helpful.

                    Extraordinary. Meets an elite standard by which you judge all other restaurants. The staff is always ready to help, the premises are extremely clean, the atmosphere is lovely, and the food is both delicious and beautifully presented.

                    Good. A fine example of a specific kind of restaurant. It can be delicious food with excellent service. You may think about returning if you wish to have that particular cuisine.
